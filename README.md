## Mathematical Framework

This work examines configurations of n unit vectors in R^d satisfying two constraints:
1. Centering: sum of vectors equals zero
2. Isotropy: empirical covariance matrix equals (1/d)I

The resulting objects, termed harmonic polytopes, exhibit properties connecting:
- Galois theory and cyclotomic fields
- Spectral analysis and graph Laplacians  
- Information theory and entropy maximization
- Transformer positional embeddings and attention mechanisms

## Key Results

- Harmonic configurations maximize spectral entropy under geometric constraints
- The harmonic Laplacian Î” = I - A provides spectral characterization
- Three construction algorithms with polynomial complexity
- Connections to Chebyshev polynomials and oversmoothing in neural networks
- Stability bounds under perturbations

## Applications

- Mathematical foundation for sinusoidal positional embeddings
- Spectral analysis of transformer attention mechanisms
- Geometric optimization for balanced vector configurations
- Connections between discrete geometry and continuous analysis

## Background

The exposition develops concepts from elementary principles. Basic familiarity with linear algebra and complex numbers is helpful but not required.
